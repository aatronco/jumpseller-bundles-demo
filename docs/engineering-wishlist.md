# Bundles / Packs — Engineering wishlist

This demo (`alejandrotest`) shows **how a bundles/packs feature would look and behave** in a
Jumpseller store, built 100% in the theme (Liquid + JS), so the engineering team can take it to a
**native platform implementation**. The focus was **design and experience**, not tooling.

- Full design: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-09-bundles-demo-design.md`](superpowers/specs/2026-06-09-bundles-demo-design.md)
- Implementation plan: [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-09-bundles-demo.md`](superpowers/plans/2026-06-09-bundles-demo.md)

## What the demo does today (and its limits)

**A pack = a virtual product** (price 0, unlimited stock) with ONE custom field
`bundle_components` = comma-separated permalinks, optional `permalink?qty:N` / `permalink?variant_id:<id>`.
E.g.: `harina-1kg?qty:2,huevo-deshidratado-equivalente-a-5-huevos,mantequilla-250-g`.

When the pack is added to the cart, `assets/bundles.js`:
1. resolves each permalink → `product_id` at runtime (fetching the product's HTML and reading
   `.product-json[data-productid]`, because **Liquid can't look up an arbitrary product by
   permalink** — see wish #1);
2. adds the $0 anchor + the components via `Jumpseller.addMultipleProductsToCart(...)`;
3. stores ONLY stable references (permalinks + qty) in `localStorage`, never prices;
4. on the cart page, groups the lines under the anchor, **sums the real cart-line prices**
   (with promotions applied, always current), locks component quantities, and wires "Remove pack"
   (atomic) and "remove a component → break the pack".

The product page shows the **summed pack price** (instead of the $0 anchor), reading each
component's `price_with_discount_formatted` so product-level discounts are reflected.

**Known demo limits (to solve in the native version):**
- Membership lives in `localStorage` → **per-device**, lost if the browser is cleared.
- Permalink→id resolution is client-side (N requests on add).
- If a component is also bought **standalone**, Jumpseller merges both into a single line per
  variant → grouping and atomic removal become ambiguous. The demo assumes components dedicated
  to the pack.
- Grouping is visual only on the **cart page** (checkout is a non-editable React SPA); inventory
  and totals are still correct because components are real line items.

## Wishes for the native version

### 1. Backend component resolution + Liquid objects
Today we resolve permalinks→product in JS because **Liquid exposes no way** to get an arbitrary
product by permalink (only `product` on the product page and `collection.products`).
**Wish:** have the platform store the pack relationship server-side and expose, in Liquid, the
already-resolved components (id, name, image, **live price with promotions**, stock) and the
**groups inside the cart's `order.products`**. This removes the resolution JS and the
`localStorage`, and makes grouping **device-independent**.

> ⚠️ **Lesson from the demo (don't cache prices):** an early version stored compiled
> name/price/image in a custom field. **Wrong:** if a component's price changes, the cache goes
> stale. The rule is **store only stable references (id/permalink/variant) and always read
> price/stock live.** The native version must respect this.

### 2. Native batch add-to-cart
The storefront **already has** `Jumpseller.addMultipleProductsToCart([[id,qty],...], {callback})`
and we use it. **Wish:** expose that batch-add at the **API/platform** level too, and as a "pack"
concept (adding the pack adds its components as one atomic operation, not N calls).

### 3. Native `pack` product type (instead of custom fields)
Instead of encoding components in a text custom field, a first-class **`pack` product type**
(idea borrowed from BigCommerce), with its own admin editor to pick components and variants. The
$0 anchor would no longer be a hack.

### 4. Customer variant selection
In v1 variants are admin-only (the parser already understands `?variant_id:`). **Wish:** let the
customer choose each component's variant on the storefront (e.g. size, color).

### 5. Resolve the "component also bought standalone" case
Today Jumpseller merges identical lines by variant. **Wish:** have server-side membership
distinguish "this unit belongs to a pack" from "this unit is standalone", so grouping and removal
are unambiguous.

### 6. Pack discount → A NATIVE PACK PROMOTION IS NEEDED
The bundle saving (e.g. **20% off the components when the pack is in the cart**) must be a
**platform** discount, NOT theme logic (the theme/JS can't change what's charged, only display it).
**Conclusion after testing the current engine: the existing promotions are NOT enough — a native
"pack" promotion/concept is needed.**

**Evidence (tested live on `alejandrotest`, 2026-06-09):** we tried to model it with `buy_x_get_y`
promotions (X = the pack product, Y = a component):
- One promo with Y = the 3 components → discounts **only 1** (the cheapest), not all three.
- Three separate promos (X=pack, Y=harina / Y=huevo / Y=mantequilla), all `cumulative:true` →
  **only one fires** (the harina one). Cause: `buy_x_get_y` **consumes 1 unit of X (the pack)** per
  application; with a single pack in the cart, the other two promos have no trigger left.
- (A "2x Harina" promo did manage to discount both harina units, but the "all components" problem
  remains.)

**Why it matters:** there's no clean way to express "1 pack ⇒ ALL its components at N% off" with the
current engine without hacks (putting components in a dedicated category + a `target=categories`
promo conditioned on the pack, which is fragile and mixes concepts). A native **`pack` product type**
(see wish #3) with its own combo discount would solve it at the root.

**API note:** creating `buy_x_get_y` promotions via the API fails (`Condition_qty must be >= 1`) —
appears to be admin-only. The `discount_target` for specific products is `buy_x_get_y` (not
`products`).

**The good part (theme side):** the cart already reads each line's real price, so **any** discount
the platform applies is reflected in the pack total **automatically, without touching the theme**.
The only separate decision: whether the **product page** should preview the discounted price (the
front-end would need to know the %).

### 7. Pack stock derived from its components
**Left open by the user:** what happens if a component is out of stock? Today we rely on the SDK's
add-to-cart already blocking it (the callback returns `data.status ≠ 200`). **Wish:** have the pack
show availability derived from the **minimum** stock of its components (not purchasable if any is
sold out), with a clear message on the pack page.

### 8. App or native?
All of this **could** live in a Jumpseller App, but ideally it's **native platform support** so any
theme benefits without installing anything.

## Demo implementation map (for a quick read)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `theme/partials/product_bundle.liquid` | Emits `<product-bundle>` + JSON (pack id/url/name + raw `bundle_components`) when the product has the field. |
| `theme/assets/bundle-core.js` | Pure functions (UMD, tested): `parseBundleComponents`, `normalizePermalink`, `sumPrices`, `formatPrice`, `parsePrice`. |
| `theme/assets/bundles.js` | Browser glue: intercepts add-to-cart, resolves ids/prices, batch-add, groups the cart, live sum, atomic remove / break pack. Exposes the resolved contract as `window.JBBundles.bundle`. |
| `theme/assets/bundles-cart.css` | Visual grouping (`.jb-pack` box, "PACK" badge, indented components). |
| `theme/components/product-form.liquid` | Includes `{% render 'product_bundle' %}` at the end of the form. |
| `theme/components/product-fields.liquid` | Hides `bundle_components` from the customer-facing details. |
| `theme/templates/layout.liquid` | Loads `bundle-core.js` + `bundles.js` after `theme.js`. |
| `scripts/setup-demo-bundles.mjs` | Seeds the demo data (custom field + pack `pack-queque-casero` + value). Throwaway. |
| `tests/bundle-core.test.js` | Unit tests for the pure logic (`npm test`). |

**Demo data on `alejandrotest`:** custom field `bundle_components` (id 88114); pack
`pack-queque-casero` (id 35681868, $0) with components Harina ($2,000) + Huevo deshidratado
($2,000) + Mantequilla ($3,500). Three disabled `buy_x_get_y` pack promos exist for reference
(889140 / 889168 / 889169).
